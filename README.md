# Flag generator

This is a random flag generator using [P5.js](https://p5js.org/). It generates random flags that feel like real country flags.

## Weighted random

Almost every random choice made by the program is weighted according to probabilities that mimic distribution of real country flags characteristics. It allows to create flags that feel like real flags instead of totally random flags. In consequence, it will sometimes accidentally generate some already existing flags.
